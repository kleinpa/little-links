Little Links is a Chrome extension that makes it easy to share a shortened link based on the active tab's URL. Clicking the extension button will match the current tab's URL against a set of shortening rules and the result will be displayed in a popup and placed into the system clipboard.

This extension is focused on generating official short URLs using domains like `youtu.be` and `amzn.com`. Third-party URL shortening services like `bit.ly` are out of scope for now.

A library of rules for popular websites can be found in [rules.json](chrome_extension/rules.js). Contributions are welcome.
